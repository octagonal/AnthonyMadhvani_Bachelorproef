# The example app

In order to give a fair representation of each development method's benefits and downsides,
a single app will be built each time using a different design pattern. This will, among other things,
make it possible to give accurate assessments in terms of performance and development speed.

When choosing what kind of application will fit that purpose, common application usage is the
most important qualifier. Developing an application whose purpose is very uncommon or niche would
only serve as a theoretical exercise.

## What it should do

* Asynchronously load images

* Make multi-threaded network calls

* Consume an API

* Make adjustments to the system

* Use a service to give periodical updates to the user

* Implement and use a custom view

* Implicitly call other activities, both internal and external

With these requirements in mind, an example app has been chosen.

## The app: WikiaArt Image Downloader

WikiArt is a website which serves as a central repository for art throughout the ages.
Relevant to the app requirements, it has an API and contains high-resolution imagery.
Using their API an app will be constructed that allows users to browse art and choose a new wallpaper.
