# Preface

My motivation behind this thesis was first and foremost the realization of my own shortcomings in developing software.


As I took on ever more challenging projects, the complexity of structuring software -and structuring it well- became clear.
This problem was not as easily solved as I had hoped,
because for every pristine and seemingly perfect design pattern a range of messy concrete details were hidden just out of sight.

Because simply moping about it turned out tiresome, I decided to translate this frustration into something others might find useful:
a way to implement these abstract structures onto a physical device.
Something tangible.

A word of thanks goes out to my promotor Mr. Walcarius and the lovely developers of `reddit.com/r/androiddev` `androidchat.slack.com` who dutifully served as my collective "second reader".
I'm not sure how this project would have turned out without the help of everyone who supported and guided me.

As this thesis was written with implementation in mind, I sincerely hope you will find it useful in your daily work (even if just in a small way).
