  abstract = {Software Testing Techniques, 2nd Edition is the first book-length work that explicitly addresses the idea that design for testability is as important as testing itself not just by saying that testability is a desirable goal, but by showing the reader how it to do it. Every chapter has testability guidelines that illustrate how the technique discussed in the chapter can be used to make software more easily tested and therefore more reliable and maintainable. Application of all techniques to unit, integration, maintenance, and system testing are discussed throughout this book.As a self-study text, as a classroom text, as a working reference, it is a book that no programmer, independent software tester, software engineer, testing theorist, system designer, or software project manager can be without.},
